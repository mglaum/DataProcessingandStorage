# DataProcessingandStorage
Madeleine Glaum 

**How to Run: **
- Clone the project from github
- Run the project in CLion
- For the sake of testing, I have printed any exceptions to the console instead of having them interrupt the run of the code.
- All outputs of the code are printed to the console
- Used Fig 2's test cases and outputs for testing

**Assignment Modification** 
- I felt like this project was very straightforward and I enjoyed the idea of physically coding an enterprise concept as it helped me to understand it better. I felt the instructions were straightforward and easy to follow. One thing I may change is suggest the use of data structures to keep track of the transactions and commits, like a hashmap, for students who feel stuck about how to begin. I also may include in the resources something about writing code to create effective exception handling.
